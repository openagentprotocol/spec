# OAP vs UCP — Comparison

**Version:** 2025-07-01

Google's **Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** and OAP share a common philosophy: define an open, discoverable interface so any agent can interact with any service without bespoke integrations. They differ in scope and in which problems they treat as protocol-level concerns.

## Where the Patterns Converge

### Discovery via `/.well-known/*`

Both protocols use the well-known URI convention as the canonical entry point. A consumer hits a single URL and learns everything it needs to begin interacting — no prior configuration required.

| Protocol | Discovery URL |
|---|---|
| OAP | `GET /.well-known/oap` |
| UCP | `GET /.well-known/ucp` (or Google Merchant Center registration) |

In OAP the manifest declares services, transport bindings, capabilities, and authentication requirements. UCP's equivalent exposes merchant capabilities, pricing rules, and product catalogues.

### MCP as a Transport Option

Both protocols treat MCP (Model Context Protocol) as an optional transport layer, not the baseline. In OAP, MCP is declared in the `/.well-known/oap` manifest under the `mcp` transport key:

```json
"mcp": {
  "transport": "stdio",
  "server": "oap-mcp"
}
```

UCP uses the same approach: merchants can expose UCP capabilities via an MCP server, making them directly accessible to LLM clients (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) without any additional plumbing.

### A2A Compatibility

Both protocols define a mapping to Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication structures. In OAP:

| A2A Concept | OAP Mapping |
|---|---|
| Agent Card | Agent descriptor |
| Task | Execution trace |
| Message | Event or Command |
| Artifact | Execution trace output |

UCP maps shopping tasks (cart, checkout, fulfilment) to the A2A task model in the same structural way.

## Where OAP Diverges

### No Payment Primitive

UCP integrates with Google's **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)** for secure, verified agent payments. This is a first-class protocol concern in UCP because commerce requires a trusted, auditable payment step before any fulfilment can occur.

OAP has **no payment primitive**. OAP is domain-agnostic — the same protocol works for a pricing engine, a code reviewer, a temperature sensor, or a contract negotiator. There is no concept of a verified purchase or an authorised charge at the protocol level.

**How to add payments on top of OAP:**

If you are building a commerce system on OAP, payments are modelled as regular events and commands:

```json
// Event sent to a payment agent
{
  "type": "PaymentRequested",
  "payload": {
    "orderId": "ord_123",
    "amount": { "value": "49.99", "currency": "USD" },
    "method": "card"
  }
}

// Command produced by the payment agent
{
  "type": "PaymentAuthorised",
  "payload": {
    "orderId": "ord_123",
    "transactionId": "txn_abc",
    "authorisedAt": "2025-07-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The payment agent exposes its own `/.well-known/oap` endpoint. Any other agent that needs to trigger a payment sends a `PaymentRequested` event to it and observes the resulting `PaymentAuthorised` or `PaymentDeclined` command. Whether the payment agent internally delegates to AP2, Stripe, or another system is an implementation detail invisible to the protocol.

### Authentication is Caller-Responsibility

UCP includes verified agent identity as part of the protocol — the AP2 layer ensures the calling agent is who it claims to be before authorising a transaction.

OAP delegates authentication entirely to the consumer. The `/.well-known/oap` manifest declares what is required:

```json
"authentication": {
  "type": "bearer",
  "scheme": "Bearer",
  "scopes": ["oap:read", "oap:write"],
  "tokenUrl": "https://auth.example.com/oauth2/token",
  "docs": "https://docs.example.com/authentication"
}
```

The consumer reads this block, acquires a token from `tokenUrl`, and includes it on every subsequent request. OAP supports `bearer`, `apiKey`, and `oauth2` flows. The protocol does not mandate *how* the identity is verified — that is the responsibility of the authentication endpoint.

### Scope: Commerce vs General Interoperability

| Dimension | UCP | OAP |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | Agentic commerce | Any domain |
| Primary actor | Merchant / virtual sales associate | Any agent (human, AI, IoT, service) |
| Payment | Built-in (AP2) | Domain convention (events + commands) |
| Product catalogue | Core primitive | Not in scope |
| Transport | REST, MCP, A2A | REST (baseline), MCP, A2A |
| Discovery | `/.well-known/ucp` | `/.well-known/oap` |
| Schema format | Protobuf / JSON | JSON Schema |

## Summary

OAP and UCP share the same architectural thinking — well-known discovery, optional MCP and A2A transports, and schema-first contracts. The difference is intentional: UCP solves the specific problem of agentic commerce (including payments and merchant identity); OAP solves the general problem of agent interoperability across any domain. A commerce platform could implement OAP and model UCP-style interactions purely through the event/command vocabulary, deferring payment and identity concerns to the services that specialise in them.
