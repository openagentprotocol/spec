# Design Decisions

This page documents the reasoning behind key OAP design choices. It is aimed at implementers who want to understand *why* the protocol is shaped the way it is, and at contributors evaluating future changes.

## Command Result Retrieval

### The decision

OAP does not define a synchronous response to a command. `POST /commands` returns `201 Created` to confirm the command was accepted and queued — not that it was processed. The result of processing is one or more domain events, retrieved separately.

### Why

Commands are **intents to change** a domain service. In CQRS, the write side accepts commands asynchronously and decouples them from the read side. Returning the processing result synchronously in the `POST /commands` response would couple the caller to the service's internal processing time and force a blocking API — which conflicts with this decoupled model.

The result of processing is a **published domain event** — an immutable fact that something happened, exposed via `GET /events`. This is a *notification* that the caller can observe. It is not an Event Sourcing replay mechanism.

> **Event Sourcing is an internal server pattern, not a client capability.** A service *may* use Event Sourcing internally — storing state as a replayable log of events. But clients do not get Event Sourcing semantics. `GET /events` returns whatever the server currently exposes from its event log at the time of the query. That might be a full historical log, a recent window, or a current-state view mapped to the OAP event shape (the protocol explicitly allows any of these). Clients cannot assume they can reconstruct state by replaying events from `GET /events` — the endpoint does not guarantee completeness, ordering, or replay fidelity.

The practical implication: if a caller polls `GET /events?correlationId=...` some time after submitting a command, they receive the server's current view at that moment — which may or may not include the event they are looking for, depending on how long the server retains event history. **For reliable point-in-time delivery, use a push channel** (webhook, MCP notification, or A2A message), which fires at the moment of publication.

### How to retrieve results

The canonical retrieval path uses the correlation identifier returned in the `201` response:

```
POST  /commands                        → 201 { "id": "abc123" }
GET   /events?correlationId=abc123     → [ { "type": "CounterProposed", ... } ]
```

The `id` in the `201` response is the **correlation identifier** — it is the command's CloudEvent `id`, echoed back so callers can match incoming events to their command. The field name used inside an event payload to carry this identifier is agreed between client and server; OAP does not mandate it.

### Polling vs push

Polling `GET /events?correlationId=...` is the fallback and the simplest path. For callers that need lower latency or want to avoid polling loops, three push channels are available:

| Channel | How declared | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Webhook** | `webhook.url` on service descriptor at `POST /services` | REST clients running their own HTTP server |
| **MCP notification** | `"push": true` on `mcp` transport block | LLM tooling with an active MCP session |
| **A2A message** | implicit when A2A transport is active | Agent-to-agent coordination |

The service declares which push channels it supports in the `io.oap.agents.events` capability's `push` object. Callers should check this before choosing a channel.

### Timeout and silent failures

OAP does not define a timeout protocol. If a service processes a command but produces no event (a silent failure), the caller is responsible for deciding how long to wait before treating the operation as failed. Services **should** document their expected processing times and always produce a failure event (e.g. `NegotiationFailed`, `OrderRejected`) rather than silently dropping a command.

---

## Observability and Distributed Tracing

### The decision

OAP does not define a tracing capability. The protocol surface is: commands in, events out. What happens inside a service — how long each step took, which internal components were involved, what reasoning was applied — is the service's own concern.

### Why

A tracing capability that the protocol owns would need to answer: "what happened when service X processed command Y?" The answer is almost entirely implementation-specific. One service might be a Python ML pipeline; another might be a human-in-the-loop workflow; another might be a CQRS aggregate with event sourcing. There is no protocol-level trace shape that fits all of these without either being uselessly generic or encoding implementation assumptions.

More importantly, the OAP interaction surface already provides the observable facts a caller cares about:
- **What went in**: the command (callers sent it, so they already have it)
- **What came out**: the events (`GET /events?correlationId=...`)
- **Whether it succeeded**: absence of a success event after timeout, or presence of a failure event

Anything deeper than this — step duration, internal reasoning, span trees — is **platform observability**, not protocol observability.

### Using OpenTelemetry for deep tracing

For services and callers that need distributed tracing across the OAP boundary, use **OpenTelemetry** with [W3C TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) header propagation.

#### Caller side

When submitting a command, inject the `traceparent` header into the HTTP request:

```
POST /commands
traceparent: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01
Content-Type: application/json

{ "specversion": "1.0", "type": "ProposeCounter", ... }
```

This allows the service to link its internal spans to the caller's trace.

#### Service side

OAP-compliant services **should** propagate the `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers from the incoming command request into any internal processing spans and into any outbound HTTP calls they make during command processing. This is standard OpenTelemetry HTTP instrumentation — most frameworks handle it automatically.

#### Events carrying trace context

The [CloudEvents OpenTelemetry extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/extensions/distributed-tracing.md) defines a `traceparent` extension attribute on CloudEvent envelopes. Services **may** include this on published events to allow downstream consumers to link their processing spans back to the original trace tree:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "CounterProposed",
  "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01",
  ...
}
```

This is optional and orthogonal to OAP. A service that includes `traceparent` on events is not more or less OAP-compliant — it is simply more instrumented.

#### Summary

| Concern | Owner | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| What command was sent | Caller | CloudEvent `id` + `POST /commands` |
| What events came out | Caller | `GET /events?correlationId=...` |
| End-to-end latency across services | Platform | OpenTelemetry + W3C TraceContext |
| Internal step timing and spans | Service | OpenTelemetry service instrumentation |
| Distributed trace tree | Platform | OpenTelemetry collector + backend (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.) |

OAP tells you *what* happened. OpenTelemetry tells you *how* and *when* it happened across a distributed system. They are complementary, not competing.
